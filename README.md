I wanted to make something like DevC++ but worked better and allowed me to use standard tools for the same,
So finally I settled on a container based workflow that included vscode and it's c/c++ support + clang and the ability
to install libraries as you wish

I initially to package everything inside the container but then decided that it was pointless when VSC's dev container did most of what I wanted
